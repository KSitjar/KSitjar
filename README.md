## Who Am I
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KSitjar! I used to create a lot of test automation using Cucumber, but nowadays I'm a product owner.

## What Have I Worked On
I have two, currently private, repositories for CucumberJs. One works with Selenium, the other with Puppeteer. They're meant to be starter code to help with introducing the framework to an organization.

## What Do I Know
I'm not proficient in any of these but I've coded in:
- HTML
- CSS
- Java
- JavaScript
